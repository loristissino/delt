# DELT

DELT, or *Double Entry Learning Tool*, is a web application aimed to
teach students the basic principles of accounting and/or bookkeeping.

## Aims

A student who wishes to practice with double entry accounting systems
will be able to do that using this application, where they can:

- manage an existing *firm* (if shared), or create a new one
- import and edit a *chart of accounts*
- post new journal entries
- see the ledger
- export data to a spreadsheet for further analysis

## Internationalization

The application is internationalized, both in the user interface and in
the sense that account names can be declared in more than one language.
This way, students will be able to use account names in their own
language but see the ledger with the names in another language, if they
wish so.

## Development

The application is developed in PHP, using the [Yii framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/).

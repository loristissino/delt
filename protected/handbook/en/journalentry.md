**Account fields**

You can choose an account:

  * by writing its code;
  * by typing some letters of its name and selecting it from the list;
  * by looking it up (click on the lookup icon, or double click in the field).

After the account name, you can add a specific comment by prepending the hash tag (#).
    
**Amount fields**

In the amount fields, you can activate a calculator by typing `+`, `-`, `/` or `*`.

Type `?` to get the amount that closes the account.
Type `=` to get the amount that balances the journal entry.
